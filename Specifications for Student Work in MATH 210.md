<h3 id="general-rules-for-passing-proof-based-homework">General rules for Success on Proof-Based Homework</h3>
<p>(Modified from <a href="https://thalestriangles.blogspot.com/2016/08/expectations-in-analysis.html">Joshua Bowman’s specifications</a>.)</p>
<p>A successful homework assignment requires that you understand the role of mathematical proofs. Proofs are how we as individuals and as a community determine the truth of mathematical statements, i.e., theorems. Here is one definition of a proof, due to David Henderson: A proof is “a convincing communication that answers – Why?” The extent to which a proof succeeds, therefore, depends on how well it embodies these three properties: it should be logical (does it convince?), it should be comprehensible (does it communicate?), and it should be intentional (does it answer why?). Evidently, each of these properties depends somewhat on the others.</p>
<ul>
<li>A successful proof makes an argument for the truth of a mathematical statement that is fully convincing to an informed reader or listener. It employs appropriate vocabulary and carefully chosen notation. It avoids sloppy reasoning. It makes clear use of the theorem’s assumptions and, when necessary, previously known results. The best examples provide motivation for the methods chosen. Minor revisions may be advisable, but they do not hinder the overall effectiveness.</li>
<li>A quasi-successful proof contains most of the ideas necessary to make a complete argument. It may have slips in logic or notation, or it may neglect a special case, or it may be hard to read. It contains sufficient evidence, however, that the argument can be “salvaged” by filling in gaps or clarifying language. Serious revision is necessary.</li>
<li>An unsuccessful proof does not convince an informed person of the truth of the purported theorem, for one or more of the following reasons: – It makes logical leaps or omits key ideas. – It demonstrates incomplete understanding of definitions or notation. – It fails to reference previous results when appropriate. Complete revision is generally necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, a successful proof is of sufficient quality that it could reasonably be accepted as part of a paper in a professional journal. A quasi-successful proof has some merit, but it requires revision, after which it might or might not be acceptable at a professional level. An unsuccessful proof is sufficiently flawed that it would not be acceptable as part of a professional publication.</p>
<h3 id="general-rules-for-passing-non-proof-based-homework">General Rules for Success on Non-Proof-Based Homework</h3>
<p>Success on a non-proof-based homework assignment requires that you be aware of the four different kinds of error that can occur when doing significant work in mathematics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Computational error</strong>. This occurs when a mathematical computation (calculus, algebra, arithmetic, etc.) is incorrectly carried out, either by hand or on a computer. For example: Given the equation $3x=9$ and arriving at $x=2$ is a computational error.</li>
<li><strong>Logical error</strong>. A logical error occurs when a conclusion is drawn erroneously from a set of information. For example: Given the equation $x^2 = 9$ and concluding that $x$ must be positive is a logical error.
<li><strong>Syntax error</strong>. Syntax errors occur in one of two ways. First, they can occur as errors in English grammar, when the rules for language usage are not followed correctly, especially to the point that they obscure the thought process in the solution or introduce new errors. Second, they can occur as errors in the usage of mathematical notation, especially if the misuse of notation obscures the solution or introduces new errors. For example, in calculus the misuse of the pronoun “it” without clear reference to an antecedent is a particular problem (example: “It is increasing because it is positive”). In mathematical notation, syntax errors can be caused by switching variables mid-solution (for example, solving $3t=9$ to get $x=3$ is an error), by misusing function notation, mismatching parentheses, and a host of other possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic error</strong>. Semantic errors occur when the rules of the <em>grammar</em> of a language are followed but the resulting statements are nonsensical or meaningless. For example, the statement “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously” is correct English syntax but has no meaning, therefore it represents a semantic error. In mathematics, a similarly semantically erroneous statement would be “The following graph can be factored”. This is a semantic error because we don’t “factor” graphs; we factor polynomials and integers, and to say we are “factoring a graph” is meaningless.</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, these errors are closely linked together, and an error in one category usually introduces an error in one of the others. The general rule for MATH 210 is: <strong>Homework should be almost, if not entirely free of all of the above kinds of error; and there should be no significant instances of any of these errors.</strong> That is, a small number of minor errors can be tolerated as long as they do not make the answer incorrect or significantly obscure the thought process in the solution. But large numbers of minor errors, or a single instance of a major error, will result in the work not being professional quality.</p>
<p>For these items, we will often refer to the <strong>standard audience for MATH 210</strong>, which is defined to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard audience in MATH 210 consists of classmates in MATH 210 who are familiar with the mathematical ideas discussed in the class and have the appropriate background knowledge for the class, but who are unfamiliar with the particular problem whose solution you are presenting and therefore need to be persuaded that your solution is correct and your conclusions believable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore some items will not need to be discussed in a solution; for example, if a problem involves solving $3x=9$ you can jump straight to $x=3$ without showing work. But for example, if a problem is asking you to compute a derivative using the Chain Rule, you will need to show all the calculus steps because the standard audience has not seen your problem. (You could skip the algebra steps needed to simplify the solution, but then you must be 100% assured that your simplified answer is correct.)</p>
<p>In addition to the above, here are some special rules for other aspects of your work on Written Homework.</p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-supporting-work">Criteria for supporting work</h3>
<p>In Homework, it is crucial that you <strong>not only give an answer or a conclusion but also clear, complete, and correct work that backs up your answer or conclusion</strong>. Submitted work that consists only of answers is not professional quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <em>Homework</em> in which you are asked for a clearly-defined answer to a computational problem, the answer must be clearly indicated (for example, by drawing a box around it), and there must be supporting work free of significant gaps for the standard MATH 210 audience that clearly supports your answer.</li>
<li>Answers or conclusions that are given that have only minimal supporting work, or for which the relationship between the answer/conclusion and the supporting work is tenuous, illogical, or unclear are not professional quality and will be returned without further feedback.</li>
</ul>
